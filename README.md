# Embed Local Video in a Reveal Presentation

A simple [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) plugin that lets you embed video from local sources
(such as a webcam) on a presentation.

I use this when giving online talks. It lets me put myself on top of
slides, in any position (including full screen).

## Demo

[Live Demo](http://thomas.weinert.info/reveal-embed-video/example/index.html)


## Usage

```HTML
<div class="reveal" data-video="small top-right">
  <section class="slides">
    <section>
      ... regular slide
    </section>
    <section data-video="big top-right">
      ... slide with large video 
    </section>
  </section>
</div>  
```

The `data-video` attribute contains class names. If a slide
does not have it the plugin looks at its ancestor nodes. 

The default classes are:

   * `big` = video width 90% of browser window
   * `small` = video width 15% of browser window
   * `top-left` = position top left corner
   * `top-right` = position top right corner
   * `bottom-left` = position bottom left corner
   * `bottom-right` = position bottom right corner
   
If you set only a position the video width will be 25% of the browser
window.

You can define and use you own CSS classes to position/format the video element.
The video element always has the class `live-video` to avoid conflict with other
videos in your presentation.

```CSS
video.live-video.your-class {
  /* your css definitions */
}
```

You can set the `data-video` attribute to `false` to disable the video.

### Keyboard Shortcut

Use the key `[C]` to enabled/disable the video. By default it will be disabled at 
start. The `enabled` option can change this.

### Switching Video Input

If you have multiple video inputs (front ant rear camera) you can click on 
the video to cycle trough them.

## Installation

There are several ways to install reveal_external:

* The manual way: Save `reveal-embed-video.js` and `reveal-embed-video.js` into your 
  project structure
* Install with bower: bower install reveal_embed_video

## Configuration

Add the plugin to the dependencies:

    dependencies: [
        ...
        { src: 'vendor/reveal-embed-video.js' },
        
### Options

    'embed-video': {
        enabled: false, // optional, default false
        persistent: false, // optional, default false
        path: '/path/to/plugin' // optional, default null
    }       
    
#### enabled

Enable the video stream directly at startup. Pressing `[C]` will still allow you to 
toggle it.

#### persistent

Keep the stream open (the camera active) after opening it once. If it is enabled
the plugin will keep the camera on even if the video is not used. This avoids repeat permission
request dialogs.

#### path 

The path for the css file (`reveal-embed-vide.css`). The plugin will try to calculate that itself.

## Limitations

Most modern browsers will not allow local media devices to be opened
from `file://` pages. To use this locally, you need to serve your
presentation using a local web server (such as `npm start`).

### IE 

Doesn't work.

### Edge

Works if you add [a shim](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter).
